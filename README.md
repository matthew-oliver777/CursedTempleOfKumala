# CursedTempleOfKumala

Hello, my name is Matthew Oliver and this is my first creative OOP project.
This is also the first programming project in general where I have had full creative freedom!

This project was mostly inspired by my love of adventure video game titles with consequences.
Mainly the 1983 Laserdisk classic, Dragon's Lair, and the hilarious 1990 point-and-click PC game, The Secret of Monkey Island.

When I first began brainstorming this project, I was tempted to just recreate the entirety of Dragon's Lair to code.
My reasoning was it cuts out the underestimated amount of time it takes to create a fictional story with a begining and end.

I ulitmately decided to create a two-choice event pick-your-own adventure title since i believed it would be good practice.
The setting would be a jungle temple containing a treasure, and a protagonist trying to find that treasure.
The narrative was a bit difficult to plan, but I am overall satisfied with what I came up with.
Very early on in my write-up of the story, I was finding myself trying to create a serious narrative.
I quickly backed down and made the story more humorous since I couldn't take my own story seriously.

I will say that my love for the Indiana Jones franchise was one-hundred percent my inspiration for the location setting and
characterization of the protagonist.

Anyway, I really hope you enjoy what I have made so far. I will continue to post updates for the project as I work through testing.
I intend to start with the basics and test as frequently as I can; it really cuts down on error testing later.

Have a wonderful day and I hope you enjoy a Fantasy Adventure filled with danger, and hopefully a few laughs!
